We currently have **${totalMembers} members** in our community.

**- __Be a Good Vibe Curator__** :star2: Weâ€™re here to make memories, not drama! Respect others, spread kindness, and help create a friendly atmosphere where everyone can feel welcome and included.

**- __No Spamming, Please__** :no_entry_sign: Spam belongs in cans, not in chat! Keep conversations flowing, and donâ€™t flood the chat with repeated messages or unnecessary pings. Quality over quantity!

**- __Respect Boundaries__** :no_pedestrians: Keep it respectfulâ€”no hate speech, bullying, or harmful behavior. Weâ€™re all about building each other up, not tearing others down. Disagree? Do it respectfully!

**- __Stay on Topic, Adventurer!__** :dart: This isnâ€™t a random wandering chat! Keep it relevant to the channel youâ€™re in. Letâ€™s make each conversation meaningful and funâ€”wandering off-topic is for treasure hunts, not chats.

**- __Your Privacy is Sacred__** :closed_lock_with_key: Donâ€™t slip into someoneâ€™s DMs without permission. Be respectful of othersâ€™ boundaries, and always ask before sending a message. Trust is earned, not forced.

**- __Memes Are Love, but Not Spam__** :joy: We love a good meme, but donâ€™t overdo it! Keep memes in the dedicated channels, and remember: one funny picture doesnâ€™t mean the whole chat should be filled with them.

**- __Give Credit Where Itâ€™s Due__** :pencil: If youâ€™re sharing someone elseâ€™s work or idea, make sure to credit them! Whether it's art, music, or a funny joke, always respect creators' rights.

**- __Use Channels Wisely__** :books: Each channel has a purpose! Donâ€™t post random stuff in places meant for serious conversations. Keep it neat and follow the guidelines pinned in each channel!

**- __No NSFW or Explicit Content__** :no_entry_sign::underage: This is a community space for all ages! Keep it appropriate and free of explicit content. Any violations will be met with immediate action. Respect the vibe!

**- __Have Fun and Get Involved!__** :tada: Weâ€™re here to build friendships and enjoy each otherâ€™s company! Join events, start a conversation, or share your passions. The more you engage, the more fun youâ€™ll have!

**- __The Golden Rule: Make This Place Awesome!__** :sparkles: Youâ€™re the heart of this server! Help make it a welcoming, fun, and supportive space for everyone. Share your ideas, create cool memories, and always leave a positive mark on our community. Letâ€™s make this a place weâ€™re all proud to call home!

By being part of this server, you agree to follow these rules. Violations may result in warnings, temporary mutes, or bans.
